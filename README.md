# Liaths Github Page

## About the page
This was made only as a fun project after not having the motivation to code for a long time. I saw [a video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zswyWBtF-7Y) about the Personal web by Psychcool and decided to try it myself because I hate the idea of a corporate controlled/sanitized internet. The internet is supposed to be a place for creativity for everyone, instead today most websites look bland and unoriginal.

## About the project
At the moment, everything is made in default HTML & CSS, no frameworks or other stuff. I am importing the Link tree from a [.json](linkTree.json) file and I am really proud about that. Maybe at one point I'll get this working with react because I like the idea of having an overview about what I'm doing, but this isn't guaranteed.

## About me
My name is Liath, I am a 19 y/o transfem and I hate the capitalistic motions in our current western society. Bad website design makes me really angry too.
I am also not a native english speaker so if you happen to find any issues regarding gramar or other stuff let me know (somehow)
# Things you will NEVER see on here:
- Annoying Ads
- Popups popping up without asking as soon as the site loads
- Premium membershits (what would that even mean?)

Its important to me to keep to those standarts because that is what I always complain about when a website is trash :3
